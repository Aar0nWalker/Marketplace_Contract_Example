<h3>About</h3>

There is a simple marketplace template. Contract provides nft listing, buying and selling. Indexed events will help to parse some data for website. 

<h3>Core stuff</h3>

Contract can contain NFT while listed and transfer funds after selling. I've used structs and mappings with them to store items and collections data. As NFT importer we use IERC721.

<h3>To do:</h3>

- Add audit report
- Add tests
- Gas optimisation
- Add NFT creating feature 
- Add NFT trading feature
- Add web2 UI
